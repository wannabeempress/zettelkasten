# 🛳️✨ 30 Ships, 30 Days

---

> [!summary] 🧾 The Challenge:
>  Create **==30==** small, complete, shippable artifacts in 30 separate days. ✨

---

### 🧠 Core Intentions:

- **Build trust with my creative self** through repeated completion 🧩
- **Practice finishing over perfecting** 💅
- **Embrace constraints** to unlock clarity and action 🎯
- **Grow my public body of work** in ways that feel light, visible, and FUN!!! 🌈

### 📜 The Rules:

| Rule                                     | Description                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🗓 **One ship per day, no batching**     | You can’t make multiple artifacts in one day. <br>Each ship deserves to make a solo debut on the shipping harbour.                                  |
| 📆 **Days don’t have to be consecutive** | You better take BREAKS. This is about _30 full creative sessions_, not a 30-day grind. Don't clog the shipping lanes.                               |
| 🧩 **Only approved tools allowed**       | No rabbit holes, no shiny new tech, no hunting Moby Dick. 🙅‍♀️ Stick to the status quo-o-oooooo 🎶                                                 |
| ✂️ **Only MVPs allowed**                 | Each ship must be the _simplest functional version_. ~~Polish is for shoes~~ <br>Functional paddleboats > 1/4 done cruise ships. <br>Done > Perfect |
| 🌐 **Must be published and linked**      | Every artifact must be uploaded somewhere shareable (e.g., itch.io, blog, website, email wall). <br>"Done" = discoverable.                          |

### 📦 What Counts as a Ship?

- A finished, uploaded project people can click, read, play, or watch
- Any creative _artifact_ that _exists and is public_ 💁‍♀️

---

### 💭 NOTES TO MYSELF, LESHGOOOOO:

- You don’t need to impress people with size. **Completion is rare and powerful.**
- Most people _never_ finish anything. Any ship, no matter how simple, is ✨already magic✨. It's a SHIP 🛳️ choo chooooo *foghorn*
- You can **come back later** and upgrade any ship, but only after the ship's made it to the harbour. 
- How many ship ==metaphors== can I include in this page? Should keep editing it until it's nearly non-sensical with nautical metaphors lol. To anyone reading this page, send me your metaphors hahahahaha.
- **Constraints** are your creative besties — they turn overwhelm into _momentum_.
- As Nicole van der Hoeven said in that video you re-watch all the time, learn in public 
- As Zsolt of Excalidraw fame says, make it visual 
- As Cal Newport says, GO DEEP and insert Greek mythology references
