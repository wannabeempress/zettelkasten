### 🛳️ What Counts as a Ship?

| Rule                                | Description                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🛳️ **Solo ships, no batching!**    | You can’t make multiple artifacts in one day. <br>Each ship deserves to make a solo debut on the shipping harbour.                                  |
| 📆 **Made in ONE day**              | BUT you better take BREAKS. This is about _30 full creative sessions_, not a 30-day grind. Don't clog the shipping lanes.                           |
| 🧩 **Made with approved tools**     | No rabbit holes, no shiny new tech, no hunting Moby Dick. 🙅‍♀️ Stick to the status quo-o-oooooo 🎶                                                 |
| ✂️ **MVP**                          | Each ship must be the _simplest functional version_. ~~Polish is for shoes~~ <br>Functional paddleboats > 1/4 done cruise ships. <br>Done > Perfect |
| 🌐 **Must be published and linked** | Every artifact must be uploaded somewhere shareable (e.g., itch.io, blog, website, email wall). <br>"Done" = discoverable.                          |

### 💭 NOTES TO MYSELF, LESHGOOOOO:

- You don’t need to impress people with size. **Completion is rare and powerful.**
- Most people _never_ finish anything. Any ship, no matter how simple, is ✨already magic✨. It's a SHIP 🛳️ choo chooooo *foghorn*
- You can **come back later** and upgrade any ship, but only after the ship's made it to the harbour. 
- How many ship ==metaphors== can I include in this page? Should keep editing it until it's nearly non-sensical with nautical metaphors lol. To anyone reading this page, send me your metaphors hahahahaha.
- **Constraints** are your creative besties — they turn overwhelm into _momentum_.
- As Nicole van der Hoeven said in that video you re-watch all the time, learn in public 
- As Zsolt of Excalidraw fame says, make it visual 
- As Cal Newport says, GO DEEP and insert Greek mythology references
