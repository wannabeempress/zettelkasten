# 🪞✨ Why I Chose This Path  

> _Found your way here first?_ You might want to know [[Identities/My Identities\|Who I Am]]

**For neurodivergent dreamers, system-shifters, and cycle-breakers creating magical, livable lives.**

## 🔮 My North Star

I’m not just going to study social work + [[Thinking/Zettels/(3B) Coaching\|(3B) Coaching]].  
I’m **reweaving ideas, beliefs and systems** for neurodivergent dreamers, feelers, and cycle-breakers (and this work starts with me!)

I choose this path because I believe in transformation rooted in compassion.  
Because I know that systems can heal or harm, and I want to be the architect of better ones.

I’m building a life where deep care, creativity, and growth go together like kiwi on pavlova, where I don’t have to choose between my softness and my strategy, my sparkle and my science. [[Thinking/Zettels/(1A1A1B1) My Daily Actions And Thoughts Cultivate My Garden Of Identity\|(1A1A1B1) My Daily Actions And Thoughts Cultivate My Garden Of Identity]] and will ultimately lead me to my long-term vision.

## 🌱 Origin Story

There wasn’t just one “aha” - more like a breadcrumb trail of burnout, breakthroughs, and brave pivots:

- Realising that healing isn’t linear, it’s spiral-shaped, like vines reaching for the sun  
- Discovering how empowering it feels to *name* what's happening - through language, frameworks, and shared understanding  
- Finding out I can create and influence systems that feel like a hug, not a vise 

I thought I was broken. I'm not - I'm a resourceful and passionate individual who needed tools, community and systems that honoured my brain. 

I'm stepping up and stepping into who I needed when I was younger.

## 💖 Why It Matters

- Because neurodivergent adults deserve support that’s built *for* them - not just adapted after the fact  
- Because language shapes experience, and I'm here to make the invisible visible  
- Because transformation shouldn’t feel like punishment  
- Because if society disables us, then why shouldn't we build our own ramps - and make them glittery too?
- Because I’ve been the person who needed a system that saw me as whole --- and I’m becoming the person who builds it
