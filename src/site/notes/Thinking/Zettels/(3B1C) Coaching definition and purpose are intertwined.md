The [[Thinking/Zettels/(3B) Coaching\|Definition of coaching]] can't seem to be extricated from the [[Thinking/Zettels/(3B1) Purpose of Coaching\|(3B1) Purpose of Coaching]] because [[Thinking/Zettels/(3B8) Coaching is future focussed\|(3B8) Coaching is future focussed]] and as a result how you describe what it is almost always talks about what it is meant to do. 

Here's how I have defined coaching: 
[[Thinking/Zettels/(3B) Coaching#Coaching is a reflective social process that centres and empowers the coachee to evaluate their own ideas and options, and use their own agency to make meaningful progress.\|(3B) Coaching#Coaching is a reflective social process that centres and empowers the coachee to evaluate their own ideas and options, and use their own agency to make meaningful progress.]]

The process itself needs to take into account its purpose: making meaningful progress in the life of the coachee. 

However, if you describe something like basketball, you could say it is a ball sport played on a court with two teams (why did I pick a sport I know nothing about). If you ask someone what is the purpose of basketball, you might get answers like: 
- to have fun
- to make friends 
- to win 

But you cannot divorce coaching from the purpose of empowering change. Without change, it is no longer coaching.
