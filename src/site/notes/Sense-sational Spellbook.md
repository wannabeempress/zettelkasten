## Project details 

### What did you ship? 
> Part of the [[30 Ships, 30 Days\|30 Ships, 30 Days]] challenge

A Practical Guide to Harnessing the Senses for Living Your Most Magical Life. It's a 3-day self-guided journey within a PDF. Image preview below! 

I plan to set this up on my website as a proper lead magnet, but for now, it's on Google Drive: 
- Two versions of the file are available-- it's the same content. 
	- If you want to copy-paste, here's the [big version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17wWzPn-L74aGOCLNJbRWLw5FOJ1C1P6C/view?usp=sharing) [124MB]. 
	- If you just want to view, here's the [small version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17wWzPn-L74aGOCLNJbRWLw5FOJ1C1P6C/view?usp=sharing) [2MB]. 

_The big version looks prettier because it's crisper! But if you don't have unlimited data or wifi, definitely go for the 2MB version!!!!_

### 🌱 Question / Spark
> What was I curious about?

How can we creatively use mindfulness to inject some magic into daily living? Noticing is a key part of mindfulness, and rituals are a strong component of sense-making. And the 5 senses are often talked about as being important e.g. for marketing but maybe not so clearly defined on how to use them. 
### 🧠 Hypothesis / Hunch
> What did I think I knew or want to share?


That intentionally crafting our experience of senses, especially by ritualising these, will boost mindfulness and groundedness to support emotional regulation and executive function. 
### ✨ How This Relates to the Theme 
> Explicitly link this artifact to your theme. Even a sentence is magic.


Magic is about spark and levity. Intentionally refining your experiences to boost enjoyment of the senses supports feeling a sense of wonder and joy and inserts "glimmers" (Opposite of triggers from TikTok ‐ cute and useful concept)

### 🔍 Data / Life Experience
> Lived moment, convo, story, quote, etc.

> “Find ecstasy in life; the mere sense of living is joy enough.”
― Emily Dickinson

### 🗂️ Project Modularity 
> What did I re-use from other projects? Link to them (the more you reuse the better! Think like a programmer)
