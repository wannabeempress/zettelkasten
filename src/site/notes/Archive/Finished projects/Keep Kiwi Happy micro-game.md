## Project details 

### What did you ship? 
> Part of the [[30 Ships, 30 Days\|30 Ships, 30 Days]] challenge

KiwiJoy is a micro-game about seeking happiness, even if the boost you get wears off over time. 

### 🌱 Question / Spark
> What was I curious about?

I wanted to know if I could _actually_ ship a game. I've tried to make games before, but they've always been too large in scope. 

### 🧠 Hypothesis / Hunch
> What did I think I knew or want to share?

The ideas that sparked this concept were [[Baseline happiness\|Baseline happiness]] and [[Hedonic adaptation\|Hedonic adaptation]]. Humans return to a set point of happiness, despite changes in circumstances after a given point.

### ✨ How This Relates to the Theme 
> Explicitly link this artifact to your theme. Even a sentence is magic.

Knowing that happiness is fleeting and also that it persists at a certain level is kinda freeing. You don't need to chase happiness if you know that you'll return to a baseline of joy and contentment. In fact, chasing it is kind of futile. No matter how high you take yourself, you will come back down. 

There are probably other books or studies out there about raising your baseline happiness... That would be interesting. Because if you had a very low baseline of happiness, then that doesn't bode well for your overall life satisfaction!

(In the game, Kiwi has a *very low* baseline of happiness. Poor bird.) 

### 🔍 Data / Life Experience
> Lived moment, convo, story, quote, etc.
 
 I first encountered these ideas in [[@Gilbert2006StumblingHappiness\|@Gilbert2006StumblingHappiness]]* (which honestly I should re-read because it's been at least 15 years since I read it...)

*// The nice thing about having a bookworm as a dad is that you can borrow all his books. In my younger years, my dad read a lot of Tom Clancy, but he also had A LOT of non-fiction. Tom Clancy isn't for me, but I love non-fiction!!!! If ONLY I took notes and knew about zettelkasten and [[Thinking/Zettels/(1A1A1A) Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] back then... 
// I also read a LOT of Newsweek and TIME magazine. No, I wasn't popular. Why do you ask? 🤣*

### 🧰 Scope Notes
**In Scope:**  
- [ ] Sprites: Kiwi the player, Star sprite (good), Angry face sprite (bad)
- [ ] Random stars and angry faces falling down the screen 
- [ ] Basic map 
- [ ] Basic decay mechanic for happiness
- [ ] High score functionality 
- [ ] Basic collision
- [ ] Kiwi stays on the screen (lol)
- [ ] Game over screen 
- [ ] Left and Right controls 
- [ ] Kiwi has basic animations for moving left and right!!!!! 

**Out of Scope (long list encouraged!):**  
- [ ] sound effects
- [ ] music
- [ ] Kiwi speeds up and down 
- [ ] more sprites to represent good and bad events 
- [ ] more complex art 
- [ ] special mode if happiness >= 11 
- [ ] Increase or decrease Kiwi's baseline happiness 
- [ ] 'Too much of a good thing' - e.g. phone sprite initially gives big boost but if you get too many in a span of time, it reduces your happiness heavily (as doomscrolling does!)
- [ ] Parallax background effect or moving background
- [ ] Moving foreground lol 
 - [ ] Mood-based background color changes (low joy = dull palette, high joy = sparkle)
-  [ ] A rest mechanic — standing still slowly raises happiness (behavioral activation/grounding) -- vs right now moving and resting does the happiness decay 
- [ ] In-game text-based event triggers (e.g. "Kiwi remembers a warm hug" = burst of joy)
- [ ] Happiness bar that changes sprite pose or expression
- [ ] Player-named Kiwi (little textbox intro)
- [ ] Pause/Reset menu (for future polish pass)

## 🪞 Reflection 

### 🗂️ Project Modularity 
> What did I re-use from other projects? Link to them (the more you reuse the better! Think like a programmer)

I don't think I managed to reuse anything from an existing project, which is a shame. Hopefully for the next ones... 

### 🧠→✨ Synthesis / Lesson
> What did I learn during the shipment?

I was starting to feel really bad while working on this game. I started thinking I had wasted the day! I wanted to give up, and I felt like it wasn't going anywhere. I had to really think about what the simplest version of this game could be and then just ship THAT. When I hit export after I finished the game, I felt so excited. Like, yay. I did that. 

Also, lol. It was interesting vibe coding? I did some of the game logic, but I admit I asked ChatGPT for help with the more complicated stuff like collision and decay. 
### 🧭 STOP • START • KEEP
- ✖️ Stop: 
	- Trying to remember what I did the day before and work on my project template *during* the project hahahaha 
	- Writing code inside Pico-8 (do it on Pycharm or SOMETHING ELSE)
- 🔁 Start:
	- Recording out of scope ideas in the project note. I think it would be fun if I come back to this project and added to it. Then I could add notes to the Scope info around what was later added (maybe I cross it off the out of scope list and then add a new section to this note) 
- ✅ Keep:  
	- Doing this project 🥹💖

### 🧠 Zettels or Tracts Spawned?
> Any permanent notes, insights, or essays created?

[[Thinking/Zettels/(1B2A) Copy Gamers to Reach Flow State\|(1B2A) Copy Gamers to Reach Flow State]] - I previously wrote this, and I think it applies here in a way. Games have the ability to induce flow state because of the parameters and constraints in which they operate; it's something I try and think about when designing systems in my life-- and I could do a better job around thinking about those parameters and constraints in game programming.
