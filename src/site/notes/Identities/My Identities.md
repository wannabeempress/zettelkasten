# I'm Pat Oyson-Matthan: coach, researcher, dream-weaver and systems alchemist. 
## I help people design lives that are magical, not just practical.

> I've spent years in HR and people management, seeing firsthand how systems shape the way we work and live.  
> But what if we could shape them back?  
> Now I'm on a mission to experiment with and redesign the systems around us - so they can work _with us_ and _for us_, not against us. 

As a [[Identities/Human Design 6-2\|Human Design 6-2]] [[Generator\|Generator]] [[Enneagram 7\|Enneagram 7]] [[ENFP\|ENFP]] [[Peacock\|Peacock]] person, I know I am a bright, loud and vivacious individual. I want to step into my ***favourite self***, if not my highest self. To do that, I must recognise how [[Thinking/Zettels/(1A1A1B) My Thoughts Are A Cottage Garden\|(1A1A1B) My Thoughts Are A Cottage Garden]] and how [[Thinking/Zettels/(1A1A1B1) My Daily Actions And Thoughts Cultivate My Garden Of Identity\|(1A1A1B1) My Daily Actions And Thoughts Cultivate My Garden Of Identity]] that lead me to [[Resources/My Vision for the Future - My Dream Life\|My Vision for the Future - My Dream Life]].

## What Matters Most To Me

- 💫 **Sacred Money Archetypes**: I'm a Romantic, Alchemist, and Ruler — drawn to beauty, transformation, and sovereignty. My life and business are rooted in these energies.
- 🔧 **What Systems Mean to Me**: Systems aren’t cages — they’re choreography. They can liberate our time, amplify our gifts, and hold space for the lives we actually want to live.
- 📚 **Academic & Coaching Pathway**: I'm studying Professional Coaching (Grad Cert → Grad Dip), with a long-term vision to complete a Bachelor of Nursing → Master’s → PhD. Every step is woven into my bigger vision of creating a wellbeing centre + research lab.
- 🎨 **Signature Style**: Visual. Whimsical. Deep. I use storytelling, metaphors, and joyful design to make complexity feel inviting. Think fairy fox 🦊🦋✨ meets systems map.
- 💗 **Radical Self-Compassion & Eudaimonia**: I believe in designing a life that nourishes our spirit, honours our seasons, and supports meaningful flourishing — even on the messy days.
